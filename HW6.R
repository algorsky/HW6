#Start Jess Attempting to Understand: 
#Question: Simulate Data from a hierarchical mixed effects model
#Analyze how to allocate 50 sampling events from simulated data
#In our example: we are estimating methane in ponds: Ponds have a certain number of sampling locations within them to get a sample
#Start with just a linear model

B0 <- 10
B1 <- -0.2
x = seq(0.5, 5, by = 0.5) #Max depth 5m based on cutoff for pond
#Need to code in error? - this is what gives variation in simulation


#Start goal - get a GLM to work 
#Would want to get an estimate for each pond at each depth 10 times
#For loop iterating through ponds? Then get 10 estimate each for each depth
#Uncertain how to save that into the dataframe with that structure though
for i in i:10{
  
}
mod <- glm(y ~ x, family = gaussian)


#Then - would want a mixed model with either pond as a random effect
#just trying to get overall estimate of emmissions in all ponds across a depth gradient - pond could add in undesired variation (and likely would based on trophic state)
#How would you actualyl simulate differences between pond? In real life, ponds would have different baselines and potentially differnt slopes - how do you do that in an automated way?
