#Start Jess Attempting to Understand: 
#Question: Simulate Data from a hierarchical mixed effects model
#Analyze how to allocate 50 sampling events from simulated data
#In our example: we are estimating methane in ponds: Ponds have a certain number of sampling locations within them to get a sample
#Start with just a linear model 

sim <- data.frame(matrix(data=NA, nrow = 50, ncol = 13))
colnames(sim) <- c('pond','rep','x','y1','y2','y3','y4','y5','y6','y7','y8','y9','y10')

#set regression coeffecients
B0 <- 1
B1 <- -1
x = seq(0.5, 5, by = 0.5) #Max depth 5m based on cutoff for pond
#Need to code in error? - this is what gives variation in simulation

# error can be taken from a random normal distribution

# let's say that methane varies from 0 to 200 ug/L, and we think error might be up to 30
# ug/L or so. Let's do mean of 15 and sd of 15
e = rnorm(1, mean = 15, sd = 15)

# fill in the pond column with values from 1-10 that are repeated every 5
rep = seq(1, 5, 1)
sim$rep = rep

# fill in rep with the replicate, which are from 1-5 and repeated for each pond
sim$pond = rep(seq(1, 10, 1), times = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5))

# create x values that are depth values, which are normally distributed between 0 and 5 meters
sim$x = abs(rnorm(50, mean = 2, sd = 1)) # take the absolute value so they're above 0

# need ten different error values for y
error = rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 15)

#Start goal - get a GLM to work 
#Would want to get an estimate for each pond at each depth 10 times
#For loop iterating through ponds? Then get 10 estimate each for each depth
#Uncertain how to save that into the dataframe with that structure though
for(i in 1:nrow(sim)){
for (j in 4:14){
  
  # calculate y values for the different error values
  sim[i, j] = B1*sim$x[i] + B0 +error[j-3]
}
}
mod <- glm(y ~ x, family = gaussian)


#Then - would want a mixed model with either pond as a random effect
#just trying to get overall estimate of emmissions in all ponds across a depth gradient - pond could add in undesired variation (and likely would based on trophic state)
#How would you actualyl simulate differences between pond? In real life, ponds would have different baselines and potentially differnt slopes - how do you do that in an automated way?
